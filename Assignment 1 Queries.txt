1. For each product compute the maximum and minimum sales quantities along with the
corresponding customer (who purchased the product), dates (i.e., dates of those
maximum and minimum sales quantities) and the state in which the sale transaction
took place.
For the same product, compute the average sales quantity

Query 1:

	prod, max(quant) as MAX_Q, min(quant) as MIN_Q, avg(quant) as AVG_Q

Query2:

For each combination of customer and product, output the maximum sales quantities
for NY and minimum sales quantities for NJ and CT in 3 separate columns. Like the
first report, display the corresponding dates (i.e., dates of those maximum and
minimum sales quantities). Furthermore, for CT and NJ, include only the sales that
occurred after 2000; for NY, include all sales.

Query 5:

Show for each customer and product combination, the total sales quantities for 4
quarters, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 (in four separate columns) – Q1 being the first 3 months
of the year (Jan, Feb & Mar), Q2 the next 3 months (Apr, May & Jun), and so on –
ignore the YEAR component of the dates (i.e., 3/11/2001 is considered the same date
as 3/11/2002, etc.). Also compute the average for the “whole” year (again ignoring
the YEAR component, meaning simply compute AVG) along with the total quantities
(SUM) and the counts (COUNT).
