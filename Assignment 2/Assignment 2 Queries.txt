Query 1:

For each customer, product, month and state combination, compute (1) the
customer's average sale of this product for the given month and state, (2) the
customer’s average sale for the given month and state, but for all other products (3)
the customer’s average sale for the given product and state, but for all other months.

Query 2:
For customer, product and state, show the average sales before and after each month
(e.g., February (month 2), show average sales of January (month 1) and March
(month 3). For “before” January and “after” December, display <NULL>. The “YEAR”
attribute is not considered for this query – for example, both January of 2017 and
January of 2018 are considered January regardless of the year.

Query 3:

For each product, find the median sales quantity (assume an odd number of sales for
simplicity of presentation). (NOTE – “median” is defined as “denoting or relating to a
value or quantity lying at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values or
quantities, such that there is an equal probability of falling above or below it.” E.g.,
Median value of the list {13, 23, 12, 16, 15, 9, 29} is 15.

Query 4:

For customer and product, find the month by which time, 75% of the sales quantities
have been purchased. Again, for this query, the “YEAR” attribute is not considered.
Another way to view this query is to pretend all 10,000 rows of sales data are from the
same year.
